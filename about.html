        <p>Our shipment company is an best company in the industry of transporting and we are very well kown company due to our fast and secure transportation of goods and services.The main players in this transaction are the seller/ shipper, consignee/ buyer, shipping company, and the freight forwarder.

            First, both parties need to enter a binding contract to agree on liability and build a romantic relationship for future transactions, so to speak. As soon as all papers are signed, the next step to work on is export haulage. This is simply the process of moving goods from the shipper’s warehouse to the forwarder’s place of operation.
            
            At this point, a local logistics company will be contracted to offer transport services. Where the consignee is responsible for moving the purchased goods from the seller’s warehouse, it’s far-reaching to use a forwarding company with export haulage services.
            
            Haulage services include unloading the goods from the truck when they’re delivered at the forwarder’s premises. The next formality you’ll need to take part in is export customs clearance. There are noticeable variations when it comes to customs rules since countries have different policies.
            
            A clearance transaction involves the submission of all the required documents to the relevant authorities so that the goods can be released from the country of origin. This part needs deeper insights to understand all the applicable regulations. If this feels too complicated, a better alternative is to work with a licensed clearing agent.
            
            The subsequent step is referred to as origin handling. To put it simply, and as the name suggests, origin handling is the physical inspection of the consignment by the freight forwarder or the appointed agent before it’s loaded into a ship.</p>
